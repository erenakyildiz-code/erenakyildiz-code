# Hi, I'm Eren! 👋

I'm a developer with a strong background in **Vue.js** (Composition API) and **C#**. Over the past year, I've been deeply involved in building **Seyir Defteri**, an auditing application designed specifically for contractors in the gas distribution industry. With my direct experience as a contractor, I'm focused on delivering solutions that meet industry needs, even if they aren't always apparent to users.

## 🚀 My Skills and Interests

- **Frontend Development**: Vue.js, JavaScript, Quasar Framework, UI/UX improvements.
- **Backend Development**: C#, .NET, Entity Framework, SQL Server.
- **Distributed Ledger Technology**: Indy Plenum, Indy Node – integrating decentralized solutions and exploring verifiable credentials.
- **API Integration**: Working with REST APIs and overcoming challenges like CORS issues, API data optimizations, and response parsing.
- **Mobile Development**: Using Apache Cordova for cross-platform mobile apps.
- **Data Visualization**: Leveraging vuechartjs and custom solutions to provide meaningful insights.

## 🌱 Current Projects

### Seyir Defteri
An in-development project aimed at helping gas distribution contractors conduct efficient, compliant audits. I've been the sole developer on this project, which is now in alpha testing, focusing on building maintainable and scalable solutions as the project grows.

### CrediLink  
A recent project with verifiable credentials for job and education data, similar to LinkedIn but with actual verifiable credentials. Includes a Chrome extension called **CrediLink Connect** for streamlined credential posting and verification.  
🏆 **1st Place Winner** on the **Ontology Reusable Identity Track** at the **DIF Hackathon**.

## 📈 Challenges & Values

I strive to write code that's **efficient** and **readable**, focusing on solutions that scale with user needs and industry standards. While my approach is unique, I'm constantly learning and improving to ensure my work is maintainable and impactful.
